## What you are given

You have a file called matrix.c. It contains lines at the top that defines what M and N are. Your goal is to leave M as it is define and update N so that the assembly that is made matches the file 

You also have a file called `matrix_commented.s` that has the correct assembly code for a particular value of **N** this **not the same as that given to you in the code.**

If you use make as this code exists, the executable called `matrix` will attempt to access one element, but it won't work until you have changed the defined value for N. You will change the code in main and improve the test in part C below.

## comment and determine N

1. Add comments to the assembly for function get_elem in the file `matrix_commented.s` on each line that you see a pound sign, #. I've helped you with some already.  **Comment only get_elem: assembly code and nothing else, ignoring lines beginning with a 'dot'.**

2. Use the variables r and c in the comments to help you and to demonstrate that you understand the assembly.
